    <p>In recent years, there has been an explosive growth of e-commerce websites. With the prevalence of platforms such as WordPress and WooCommerce, creating an e-commerce website couldn't be easier.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to handle physical products and sell tangible products, opening an e-commerce store may be a good choice.</p>
    <p>There are two different ways to run a successful online store:</p>
    <p>1. Create niche physical products and sell them to a dedicated group of buyers</p>
    <p>2. Buy cheap goods produced abroad, repackage them, and sell them at a markup.</p>
    <p>The first method may be very successful, but it does require a passion for the product and a willingness to conduct a lot of research, product development, and testing.</p>
    <p>However, the success of stores such as SkinnyMe Tea, Beardbrand, and Ratio Coffee shows that you can achieve amazing results in e-commerce stores.</p>
    <p>If the first method seems a bit risky for your first online business, then you can consider the second method of reselling popular overseas products. This method involves buying popular products from platforms such as AliExpress, repacking the products, and then selling them through their own stores.</p>
    <p>In addition to selling suitable products, you also need to consider how to ship them. You can handle shipping and order fulfillment yourself. Or, you can use a popular method called "direct shipping", which is handled by the manufacturer for you.</p>
