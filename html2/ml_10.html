    <p>Today, digital courses seem to be everywhere. Therefore, if you have valuable knowledge that someone will pay, then this will be a great opportunity.</p>
    <p>In addition to offering their own courses, learning platforms such as BitDegree also provide opportunities to become lecturers. This is a unique opportunity to pass on your skills and experience to thousands of people who are eager to learn new things.</p>
    <p>Digital courses can be produced in many different formats, from simple PDF downloads to self-study video courses with dozens of hours of content.</p>
    <p>Creating an online course can also be a very meaningful plan. Since it is under your control, there is no limit to how much money you can make.</p>
    <p>Like most other methods on this list, digital courses can be integrated into most styles of websites, including blogs, e-commerce platforms, and even affiliate marketing websites.</p>
    <p>If you want to create a digital course, but haven’t decided on your subject, it’s a good idea to vote on your audience. Usually, they can tell you exactly what they want to learn and are willing to pay for it.</p>
    <p>For example, the online course "Learn Scrivener Fast" is fully dedicated to helping writers learn the ins and outs of Scrivener software. The creator of this course, Joseph Michael, discovered this need by reading comments on Michael Hyatt's blog. Since then, it has developed into a six-figure business.</p>
